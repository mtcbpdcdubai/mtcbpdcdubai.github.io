üëâ If you don't know the *start-time* of the event, just mention as 12:00 AM.
üëâ Similarly, if you don't know the *end-time* of the event, just mention as 11:59 PM.
üëâ `links` is an array of objects. Each link is displayed as a button on the event card. Each object contains the following:
  ‚û°Ô∏è url: a string containing the url
  ‚û°Ô∏è text: default is "Read More", but you can change it to something else
  ‚û°Ô∏è icon: a React element such as <FaInstagram />, <FaLinkedin />, <FaVideo />, etc.

To accommodate the nuances of each of the three challenges, the technical team developed a platform to specifically cater to the DVORAK and T9 keyboard layouts, as well as to time the strings to disappear to make memory typing feasible. Each of the sessions themselves had three levels, easy, medium, and hard, and participants could try each difficulty level any number of times. The Typing Contest had 15 participants for the first session, 27 for the second session, and 49 for the third session; overall, there were 92 submissions, 55 unique participants, 8 players who completed all three challenges, and 5 winners.
